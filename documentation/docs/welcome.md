# Welcome to HORNET

![Hornet Logo](/img/logo/HORNET_logo.svg)

HORNET is a powerful, community driven IOTA node software written in Go. It is easy to install and runs on low-end
devices like the Raspberry Pi 4. a group of community developers alongside the
IOTA Foundation are responsible for building and maintaining Hornet. Hornet is a full-fledged software providing full node capabilities including full support of the
Chrysalis network update.

More information about IOTA network protocol can be found on the [IOTA website](https://www.iota.org/). Technical
information for developers is part of the [Chrysalis Developer Documentation](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/).

:::info
We have upgraded the IOTA network to version IOTA 1.5, also known as [Chrysalis](https://chrysalis.iota.org). This documentation focuses on running a node as a part of the Chrysalis network (Hornet version 0.6.0+).
 It is not valid for previous versions of Hornet, such as 0.5.x and below.
:::

By running your own node you have the following benefits:

- You have direct access to an IOTA network, instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node.
- You help the IOTA network to become more distributed and resilient by validating messages and value transactions in the IOTA network, 

## Roadmap

We will continue to update Hornet with upcoming changes to the IOTA protocol. You can visit 
the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/) for more information.

## Source Code

The source code of the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet).
