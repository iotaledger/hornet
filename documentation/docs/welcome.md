# Welcome to Hornet

Hornet is a powerful, easy to install node software written in Go.
It provides the full node capabilities including full support of the latest network updates.

By running your own node you have the following benefits:

- You have direct access to the IOTA network, instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node.
- You help the IOTA network to become more distributed and resilient by validating messages and value transactions in
  the IOTA network.

## Source Code

The source code of the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet).
