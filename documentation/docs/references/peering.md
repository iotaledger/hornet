# Peering

![HORNET Node Peering](/img/Banner/banner_hornet_peering.png)

The IOTA network is a distributed network. It uses a gossip protocol to broadcast data among nodes.
To participate in a network, each node has to establish a secure connection to other nodes in the network (to its peer neighbors), and mutually exchange messages.

## Node Identity

Each node can be uniquely identified by a `peer identity`. `Peer identity` (also called `PeerId`) is represented by a public
and private key pair.
Since `PeerId` is a cryptographic hash of a peer's public key, the `PeerId` represents a verifiable link between the given peer and its public key.
It enables individual peers to establish a secure communication channel as the hash can be used to verify an identity of the peer.

When HORNET is started for the first time, it will automatically generate a `PeerId` and save the identity's private key in the `./p2pstore/identity.key` file.
HORNET will keep the generated identity between subsequent restarts.

Each time HORNET starts, the `PeerId` is written to stdout:

```plaintext
2022-07-19T13:27:18+02:00	INFO	P2P	peer configured, ID: 12D3KooWF4B2jdZbSZFX1Z9PPKp2YQs58Hh2WfnoMKYx7yuzVx53
```

Your `PeerId` is an essential part of your `multiaddr` used to configure neighbors. For example, `/dns/example.com/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KooWHiPg9gzmy1cbTFAUekyLHQKQKvsKmhzB7NJ5xnhK4WKq`,
where `12D3KooWHiPg9gzmy1cbTFAUekyLHQKQKvsKmhzB7NJ5xnhK4WKq` corresponds to your `PeerId`.
Your `PeerId` is also visible on the start page of the dashboard.

You can find more information on the `PeerId` in the [libp2p docs page](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/).

## Addressing Peer Neighbors

To communicate to your peer neighbors, you will need an address to reach them. For that, HORNET uses the `MultiAddresses` format (also known as `multiaddr`).

`multiaddr` is a convention on how to encode multiple layers of addressing information into a single path structure that is future-proof.
Basically, `multiaddr` combines several pieces of information in a single human-readable and machine-optimized string, including network protocol and [`PeerId`](#node-identity).

For example, a node is reachable using IPv4 `100.1.1.1` using `TCP` on port `15600` and its `PeerId`
is `12D3KooWHjcCgWPnUEP8wNdbL2fx63Cmosk16xyZ25iUZagxmHb4`. A `multiaddr` encoding of this information would look like this:

```plaintext
/ip4/100.1.1.1/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KooWHjcCgWPnUEP8wNdbL2fx63Cmosk16xyZ25iUZagxmHb4
```

:::note

Consider how `ip4` is used. A common mistake is to use `ipv4`.

:::

If a node is reachable using a DNS name (for example `node01.iota.org`), then the given `multiaddr` would be:

```plaintext
/dns/node01.iota.org/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KooWHjcCgWPnUEP8wNdbL2fx63Cmosk16xyZ25iUZagxmHb4
```

You will need to find out your own `multiaddr` to give to your peers for neighboring. To do so, combine the `peerId` you received
from the stdout when the HORNET node started up, and your configured `p2p.bindAddress`. 
Replace the `/ip4/<ip_address>`/`/dns/<hostname>` segments with the actual information.

You can find more information about `multiaddr` at the [libp2p docs page](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing/).

## Adding Node Peers

Once you know your node's own `multiaddr`, it can be exchanged with other node owners to establish a mutual peer connection.
We recommended several peer neighbors between 4-6 to get some degree of redundancy.

## Finding Neighbors

You can join the official IOTA Discord server and the `#nodesharing` channel.
There, you will be able to describe your node location (Europe, Asia, etc.), with your allocated high watermark resources and ask for neighbors.

:::note

Do not publicly disclose your node `multiaddr` to all readers but wait for an individual direct chat.

:::

You can add peers using the HORNET [dashboard](../how_tos/using_docker.md#starting-hornet).
To do so, go to *Peers* and click on *Add Peer*. You can also add peers on the `peering.json` file.

This is `peering.json` example, with `ip4`, `ip6` and `dns` peers:

```json
{
  "peers": [
    {
      "alias": "Node1",
      "multiAddress": "/ip4/192.0.2.0/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KooWCKWcTWevORKa2KEBputEGASvEBuDfRDSbe8t1DWugUmL"
    },
    {
      "alias": "Node2",
      "multiAddress": "/ip6/2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888/tcp/16600/p2p/12D3KooWJDqHjhd8us8XdbKy1Adp5nV6XoI7XhjZbPWAfbAbkLbH"
    },
    {
      "alias": "Node3",
      "multiAddress": "/dns/example.com/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KooWN7F4eRAYbavnasME8WGXwkrpzWWoZSXfNSEpudmWi9YP"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Autopeering

HORNET also supports automatically finding peers through the _autopeering_ module.
To minimize service distribution in case your autopeered peers are flaky, we recommend you only use autopeering if you have at least four static peers.

Autopeering is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, set the `"p2p.autopeering.enabled"` value to `"true"`.
See the [configuration reference](configuration.md#-autopeering) for more information.

:::note 

The autopeering plugin will disclose your public IP address to possibly all nodes and entry points.
Do not enable this plugin if you do not want this to happen!

:::

Your node will use the specified entry nodes under `p2p.autopeering.entryNodes` to find new peers. `entryNodes` are also encoded as `multiaddr`:

```
/ip4/45.12.34.43/udp/14626/autopeering/8CZELJwB3aBzxJgnLMvvt1FirAwNN6jif9LavYTNHCty
```

where the `/autopeering` portion defines the base58 encoded Ed25519 public key.

By default, HORNET will peer up to four autopeered peers and initiate a gossip protocol with them.

### Entry Node

If you want to run your own node as an autopeering entry node, you should enable `p2p.autopeering.runAsEntryNode`.
The base58 encoded public key is in the output of the `p2pidentity-gen` HORNET tool. 
Alternatively, if you already have an identity in a `p2pstore`, you can use the `p2pidentity-extract` HORNET tool to extract it.

### Low/High Watermark

The `p2p.connectionManager.highWatermark` and `p2p.connectionManager.lowWatermark` configuration options define "watermark" points. 
Watermark points can be considered like a filling basin where if the `highWatermark` is reached, water will be drained until it reaches the `lowWatermark` again. 
Similarly, the connection manager within HORNET will start trimming away connections to peers if `highWatermark` peers are connected until it reaches `lowWatermark` count of peers.
These watermarks exist for a certain buffer number of peers to be connected, which will not necessarily be targeted by the gossip protocol.
