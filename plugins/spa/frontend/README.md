# HORNET SPA

Programmed using modern web technologies.

### SPA in dev mode

1. make sure to set `dashboard.dev` to true, to enable HORNET to serve assets
from the webpack-dev-server.
2. install all needed npm modules via `yarn install`.
3. run a webpack-dev-server instance by running `yarn start` within the `frontend` directory.
4. using default port config, you should now be able to access the dashboard under http://127.0.0.1:8081

The SPA is hot-reload enabled.
