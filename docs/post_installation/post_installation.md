# Post-installation

Once Hornet is deployed, all parameters are set via configuration files.

## Configuration

The most important ones are:

* `config.json`: includes all configuration flags and their values
* `peering.json`: includes all connection details to your static peers (neighbors)

> Hornet version 0.5.x targets legacy IOTA 1.0 network. Hornet version 1.x.x targets IOTA 1.5 network aka Chrysalis which is the focus of this documentation.

Depending on the installation path you selected, default configuration files may be also part of the installation
process and so you may see the following configuration files at your deployment directory:

```bash
config.json
config_chrysalis_testnet.json
peering.json
profiles.json
```

### Default configuration

By default, Hornet searches for configuration files in the working directory and expects default names, such
as `config.json` and `peering.json`.

This behavior can be changed by running Hornet with some altering arguments.

Please see the [config.json](./config.md) and [peering.json](./peering.md) chapters for more information regarding
the respective configuration files.

Once Hornet is executed, it outputs all loaded configuration parameters to `stdout` to show what configuration was
actually loaded (omitting values for things like passwords etc.).

All other altering command line parameters can be obtained by running `hornet --help` or with a more granular
output `hornet --help --full`.

## Dashboard

Per default an admin dashboard/web interface plugin is available on port 8081. It provides some useful information
regarding the node's health, peering/neighbors, overall network health and consumed system resources.

The dashboard plugin only listens on localhost:8081 per default. If you want to make it accessible from the Internet,
you will need to change the default configuration. It can be changed via the following `config.json` file section:

```json
"dashboard": {
  "bindAddress": "localhost:8081",
  "auth": {
    "sessionTimeout": "72h",
    "username": "admin",
    "passwordHash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "passwordSalt": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  }
}
```

Change `dashboard.bindAddress` to either `0.0.0.0:8081` to listen on all available interfaces, or the
specific interface address accordingly.

Even if accessible from the Internet, any visitor still needs a valid combination of the username and password to access
the management section of the dashboard.

The password hash and salt can be generated using the integrated `pwdhash` CLI tool:

```bash
./hornet tools pwdhash
```

Output example:

```plaintext
Enter a password:
Re-enter your password:
Success!
Your hash: 24c832e35dc542901b90888321dbfc4b1d9617332cbc124709204e6edf7e49f9
Your salt: 6c71f4753f6fb52d7a4bb5471281400c8fef760533f0589026a0e646bc03acd4
```

> `pwdhash` tool outputs the `passwordHash` and `passwordSalt` based on your input password

Copy both values to their corresponding configuration options: `dashboard.auth.passwordHash` and
`dashboard.auth.passwordSalt` respectively.

In order for the new pasword to take effect, you must restart Hornet.

## Configuring HTTP REST API

One of the [tasks that the node is responsible for](../getting_started/nodes_101.md) is exposing a HTTP REST API for
clients that would like to interacts with the IOTA network, such as crypto wallets, exchanges, IoT devices, etc.

By default, the HTTP REST API is publicly exposed on port 14265 and ready to accept incoming connections from the
Internet.

Since offering the HTTP REST API to the public can consume resources of your node, there are options to restrict which
routes can be called and other request limitations.

HTTP REST API related options exists under the section `restAPI` within the `config.json` file:

```json
  "restAPI": {
    "jwtAuth": {
      "enabled": false,
      "salt": "HORNET"
    },
    "excludeHealthCheckFromAuth": false,
    "permittedRoutes": [
      "/health",
      "/mqtt",
      "/api/v1/info",
      "/api/v1/tips",
      "/api/v1/messages/:messageID",
      "/api/v1/messages/:messageID/metadata",
      "/api/v1/messages/:messageID/raw",
      "/api/v1/messages/:messageID/children",
      "/api/v1/messages",
      "/api/v1/transactions/:transactionID/included-message",
      "/api/v1/milestones/:milestoneIndex",
      "/api/v1/milestones/:milestoneIndex/utxo-changes",
      "/api/v1/outputs/:outputID",
      "/api/v1/addresses/:address",
      "/api/v1/addresses/:address/outputs",
      "/api/v1/addresses/ed25519/:address",
      "/api/v1/addresses/ed25519/:address/outputs",
      "/api/v1/treasury"
    ],
    "whitelistedAddresses": [
      "127.0.0.1",
      "::1"
    ],
    "bindAddress": "0.0.0.0:14265",
    "powEnabled": true,
    "powWorkerCount": 1,
    "limits": {
      "bodyLength": "1M",
      "maxResults": 1000
    }
  }
```

If you want to make the HTTP REST API only accessible from localhost, change the `restAPI.bindAddress` config option
accordingly.

`restAPI.permittedRoutes` defines which routes can be called from foreign addresses which are not defined under
`restAPI.whitelistedAddresses`.

If you are concerned with resource consumption, consider turning off `restAPI.powEnabled`, which makes it so that
clients must perform Proof-of-Work locally, before submitting a message for broadcast. In case you'd like to offer
Proof-of-Work for clients, consider upping `restAPI.powWorkerCount` to provide a faster message submission experience.

We suggest that you provide your HTTP REST API behind a reverse proxy, such as nginx or Traefik configured with TLS.

Please see some of our additional security recommendations [here](../getting_started/security_101.md).

Feel free to explore more details regarding different API calls
at the [IOTA client library documentation](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/libraries/client.html).
