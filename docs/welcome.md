# Welcome to HORNET

![](./assets/HORNET_logo.svg)

HORNET is a powerful, community driven IOTA node software written in Go. It is easy to install and runs on low-end devices like the Raspberry Pi 4. Hornet is being built and maintained by a group of community developers alongside the IOTA Foundation. Hornet is a full-fledged software providing full node capabilities including full support of Chrysalis network update.

More information about IOTA network protocol can be found on [IOTA website](https://www.iota.org/). Technical information for developers is part of [Chrysalis documentation](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/).

> The IOTA network was upgraded to version IOTA 1.5 also know as [Chrysalis](https://chrysalis.iota.org). This documentation is focused on a running node as a part of the Chrysalis network (Hornet version 0.6.0+). It is not valid for previous versions of Hornet, such as 0.5.x and below.

By running your own node you have the following benefits:
* You have direct access to an IOTA network instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node
* You help the IOTA network to become more distributed and more resilient by validating messages and value transactions in the IOTA network

## Roadmap
Hornet will continue to be updated with the upcoming changes to the IOTA protocol. See the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/) for more information.

## Source code
The source code of the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet).
