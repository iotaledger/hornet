# Welcome to HORNET

![](./assets/HORNET_logo.svg)

HORNET is a powerful, community driven IOTA node software written in Go. It is easy to install and runs on low-end
devices like the Raspberry Pi 4. Hornet is being built and maintained by a group of community developers alongside the
IOTA Foundation. Hornet is a full-fledged software providing full node capabilities including full support of the
Chrysalis network update.

More information about IOTA network protocol can be found on the [IOTA website](https://www.iota.org/). Technical
information for developers is part of the [Chrysalis documentation](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/).

> The IOTA network was upgraded to version IOTA 1.5 also known as [Chrysalis](https://chrysalis.iota.org). This documentation is focused on running a node as a part of the Chrysalis network (Hornet version 0.6.0+).
> It is not valid for previous versions of Hornet, such as 0.5.x and below.

By running your own node you have the following benefits:

* You have direct access to an IOTA network instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node
* You help the IOTA network to become more distributed and more resilient by validating messages and value transactions
  in the IOTA network

## Roadmap

Hornet will continue to be updated with upcoming changes to the IOTA protocol. See
the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/) for more information.
