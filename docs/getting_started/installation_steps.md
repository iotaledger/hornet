# Hornet `apt` repository (Linux-distro specific)
Hornet `apt` repository is maintained by the Hornet developers. It installs Hornet as a `systemd` service under a user called `hornet`.

*Ubuntu/Debian*

**Import the public key that is used to sign the software release:**
```bash
wget -qO - https://ppa.hornet.zone/pubkey.txt | sudo apt-key add -
```

**Add the Hornet APT repository to your APT sources:**
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://ppa.hornet.zone stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hornet.list'
```

**Update `apt` package lists and install Hornet:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hornet
```

**Enable the `systemd` service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable hornet.service
```

The Hornet configuration files are located under the `/var/lib/hornet` directory. See more details on how to configure Hornet under the [post installation](../post_installation/post_installation.md) chapter.

Environment file to configure multiple default parameters are located under the `/etc/default/hornet` directory.

**Start the node;** use `systemd` service to start running Hornet on the Mainnet:
```bash
sudo service hornet start
```

### Managing the node
**Displaying log output:**
```bash
journalctl -fu hornet
```
* `-f`: instructs `journalctl` to continue displaying the log to stdout until CTRL+C is pressed
* `-u hornet`: filter log output by user name

**Restarting Hornet:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart hornet
```

**Stopping Hornet:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop hornet
```

> Please note: Hornet uses an in-memory cache, so it is necessary to provide a grace period while shutting it down (at least 200 seconds) in order to save all data to the underlying persistent storage.

See more details on how to configure Hornet under the [post installation](../post_installation/post_installation.md) chapter.

# Pre-built binaries
There are several pre-built binaries of Hornet for major platforms available including some default configuration JSON files.

This method is considered a bit advanced for production use since you have to usually prepare a system environment in order to run the given executable as a service (in a daemon mode) via `systemd` or `supervisord`.

**Download the latest release compiled for your system from [GitHub release assets](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet/releases), for ex:**

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/gohornet/hornet/releases/download/v0.6.0/HORNET-0.6.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```
Some navigation hints:
* `HORNET-X.Y.Z_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`: standard 64-bit-linux-based executable, such as Ubuntu, Debian, etc.
* `HORNET-X.Y.Z_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`: executable for Raspberry Pi 4
* `HORNET-X.Y.Z_Windows_x86_64.zip`: executable for Windows 10-64-bit-based systems
* `HORNET-X.Y.Z_macOS_x86_64.tar.gz`: executable for macOS

**Extract the files in a folder of your choice (for ex. `/opt` on Linux), for ex:**
```bash
tar -xf HORNET-0.6.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```
* Once extracted, you get a main executable file
* There are also sample [configuration](../post_installation/post_installation.md) JSON files available in the archive (tar or zip)

**Run Hornet using `--help` to get all executable-related arguments:**
```bash
./hornet --help
```

*Also double check that you have version 0.6.0+ deployed:*
```bash
./hornet --version
```

**Run Hornet using default settings:**
```bash
./hornet
```

Using this method, you have to make sure the executable runs in a daemon mode using for example `systemd`.

> Please note: Hornet uses an in-memory cache, so it is necessary to provide a grace period while shutting it down (at least 200 seconds) in order to save all data to the underlying persistent storage.

### Example of systemd unit file
Assuming the Hornet executable is extracted to `/opt/hornet` together with configuration files, please find the following example of a `systemd` unit file:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Hornet
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=hornet
PrivateDevices=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=yes

User=hornet
WorkingDirectory=/opt/hornet
TimeoutSec=1200
Restart=always
ExecStart=/opt/hornet/hornet

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

# Build from source
This method is considered a bit advanced for production use since you usually have to prepare a system environment in order to run the given executable as a service (in a daemon mode) via `systemd` or `supervisord`.

**Install Go:**

Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

**Install dependencies: Git and build-essentials:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential
```

**Check the golang/git version:**
```bash
go version
git --version
```
Make sure you have the latest version from https://golang.org/dl/

**Clone the Hornet source code from GitHub:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gohornet/hornet.git && cd hornet
```

**Build the Hornet:**
```bash
./build_hornet_rocksdb_builtin.sh
```
* it builds Hornet based on the latest commit from `main` branch
* it takes a couple of minutes

Once it is compiled, then the executable file named `hornet` should be available in the current directory:
```bash
./hornet --version
```

Example of version:
```plaintext
HORNET 0.6.0-31ad46bb
```
* there is also short commit `sha` added to be sure what commit the given version is compiled against

**Run Hornet using `--help` to get all executable-related arguments:**
```bash
./hornet --help
```

**Run Hornet using a default settings:**
```bash
./hornet
```

Using this method, you have to make sure the executable runs in a daemon mode using for example `systemd`.
