# Security 101
This topic provides a checklist of steps for running a reliable and secure node.

> Please note that servers that are reachable from the Internet are a constant target from security challengers. Please, make sure you follow minimum security essentials summarized in this article.

## Securing Your Device
The security of the device that's running your node is important to stop attackers from gaining access to it.

You should consider doing the following before running a node on your device:
* Securing SSH logins
* Blocking unnecessary ports

### Securing SSH logins
If you log into your device through SSH, you should use measures to protect it from unauthorized access. Many guides have been written about this subject. For more information, see [10 Steps to Secure Open SSH](https://blog.devolutions.net/2017/4/10-steps-to-secure-open-ssh). In addition to that, one can also leverage tools such as Fail2ban to harden security even more.

### Blocking Unnecessary Ports
Attackers can abuse any open ports on your device.

To secure your device against attacks on unused open ports, you should close all ports except those that are in use.

To do so, you can use a firewall. All operating systems include firewall options. By having a firewall in place you can completely block unused and unnecessary ports.

On a cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure or GCP, one can block ports on VPS networking settings.

## Deciding Whether to Enable Remote Proof of Work
When you're configuring your node, you have the option to allow it to do proof of work. When this feature is enabled, clients can ask your node to do remote proof of work.

Proof of work takes time and uses your node's computational power. So, you should consider it according to your infrastructure.

## Load Balancing
If you run more than one node, it's a best practice to make sure that API requests are distributed among all of them.

To evenly distribute the API requests among all your nodes, you can run a reverse proxy server that will act as a load balancer (HAProxy, Traefik, Nginx, Apache, etc.). This way, you can have one domain name for your reverse proxy server that all nodes will send their API calls to. But, on the backend, the nodes with the most spare computational power will process the request and return the response.

Broadcasted messages are atomic and nodes provides restful API to communicate, so sticky sessions or similar tech is not needed.

## Reverse Proxy
Using a reverse proxy in front of a node is considered a best practice even in case of deployment of a single node only. Reverse proxy adds an additional security layer that can handle tasks such as IP address filtering, abuse rate limiting, SSL encrypting, additional authorization layer, etc.
