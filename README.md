## Documentation

Please have a look into our [HORNET wiki](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet/wiki)

## Autopeering

**WARNING: The autopeering plugin will disclose your public IP address to possibly all nodes and entry points. Please disable the plugin if you do not want this to happen!**

The autopeering plugin is still in an early state. We recommend to add 1-2 static peers as well.
If you want to disable autopeering, you can do so by adding it to the `disablePlugins` in your `config.json`:

```json
"node": {
    "disablePlugins": ["Autopeering"],
    "enablePlugins": []
  },
```
